# Setting TORQUE for single computer

## Must do:
### `/etc/hosts`
Make sure that `/etc/hosts` look like this

```
127.0.0.1               localhost.localdomain localhost
```

where `localhost.localdomain` is your host name.

## Firewall configuration
Fedora 23 has firewall enabled. The pbs_server (server) and pbs_mom (client) by default use TCP and UDP ports 15001-15004. pbs_mom (client) also uses UDP ports 1023 and below if privileged ports are configured (the default).

Hence to open above TCP ports, first check the active zone
```
# firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```

My active zone for Fedora 23 is named `FedoraWorkstation`. Then open the ports
```
# firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-port=15001-15004/tcp
# firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-port=1023/udp
# firewall-cmd --reload
```

## Setup the server
1. Edit `/var/spool/torque/server_name` to name the head node. It is recommended to match the hostname in `/etc/hostname` for simplicity's sake. In my case, it is `localhost.localdomain`.

2. Create and configure the torque server
```
# pbs_server -t create
PBS_Server localhost.localdomain: Create mode and server database exists,
do you wish to continue y/(n)?y
```

3. Start trqauthd by running
```
trqauthd
```

4. Set the sever and create batch queue
```
# qmgr
set server acl_hosts = localhost.localdomain
set server scheduling = True
set server submit_hosts = localhost.localdomain
set server allow_node_submit = True
create queue batch
set queue batch queue_type = Execution
set queue batch started = True
set queue batch enabled = True
set queue batch max_running = 4
set queue batch resources_max.ncpus = 4
set queue batch resources_max.nodes = 1
set queue batch resources_default.ncpus = 1
set queue batch resources_default.neednodes = 1:ppn=1
set queue batch resources_default.nodes = 1
set queue batch resources_default.walltime = 24:00:00
set server default_queue=batch
```

To check the setting,
```
qmgr -c 'p s'
```

5. Edit `/var/spool/torque/server_priv/nodes` adding all compute nodes. The file will look like this
```
localhost.localdomain np=4
```

## Setup the client (on the same computer)
Edit `/var/spool/torque/mom_priv/config` to contain some basic info identifying the server:
```
$pbsserver	localhost.localdomain
$logevent	255
```

## Restart the server
```
# killall -s 9 pbs_server
# pbs_server
```

## Start the client (__Very important__)
```
# pbs_mom -A localhost.localdomain
```

Note: `-A localhost.localdomain` must be added so that the client knows which machine can submit the job. Without it, the client does not work (the state will be `down`).

## Verifying cluster status
```
$ pbsnodes -a
```

The client state should be `free`, otherwise, the client configuration fails.

## Start the queue scheduler
```
# pbs_sched
```

## Other relavants
1. `munge.service` should be enabled. If the munge-key is missing, create it by
```
# create-munge-key
```

Then start the `munge.servie`
```
# systemctl start munge.service
```
